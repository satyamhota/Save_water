              With all the severe droughts happening in the world, the limited
              supply of fresh water is becoming one of our most precious
              resources. Every person on earth needs water to survive. Without
              it, many of us would get sick and even result in death. While
              almost 70% of the Earth is made up of water, many parts of the
              world suffer from clean water shortage. Conserving water is
              important because it keeps water pure and clean while protecting
              the environment. Conserving water means using our water supply
              wisely and be responsible. As every individual depends on water
              for livelihood, we must learn how to keep our limited supply of
              water pure and away from pollution. Keeping our water supply safe
              and pure will protect the water for the generations to come. Many
              believe that our water supply infinite. However, our supply is
              quite the opposite. It is important that we must not pollute your
              water as many do not realize just how important and scarce water
              is. Only 2% of the Earth’s fresh supply of water is locked in ice
              caps and glaciers, while 97,5% of the earth’s water is saltwater.
              Conserving water involves refraining from water pollution. This
              requires the use of strategies that includes reducing wastage,
              prevent damaging water quality, and improve water management. The
              population must save the water he has today and provide a
              sufficient supply for the next coming years.

            We use water every day of our lives. It is required in almost
            everything we do. We need water for drinking, bathing, cooking,
            washing, and other countless activities. Bottom line: we need water
            for activities and habits we use regularly. If we want to continue
            to keep our bodies healthy, clean, and everything else – we must
            conserve water.

            Fruits and vegetables, as well as other produce, require water to
            grow. But if the area is suffering from a drought, how will the food
            grow? This can make sustainable living a difficult challenge as
            sectors that suffer from drought will become useless as plants of
            any kind will not be able to grow. Without water, the population
            will starve to death.

            Humans are not the only species on Earth that requires water for
            survival. In fact, every species on this planet needs water to live
            and survive. Without water, the aquatic life will stand no chance of
            survival. It is highly important that we save water that is
            essential to our sustainability.

            save more than hundreds and thousands of water every year. Use less
            water,and you will be charged less money from the water company.
